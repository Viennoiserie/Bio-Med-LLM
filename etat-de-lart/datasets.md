## Datasets

Below are the key open-source datasets for multi-omics analysis. Each dataset is widely used in the field and supports clustering, classification, and biomarker discovery tasks.

### 1. **The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)**

- **Description**: TCGA provides a comprehensive multi-omics resource with genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic datasets for various cancer types.
- **Data Types**: Multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics).
- **Use Case**: Frequently used for cancer subtype discovery, biomarker identification, and clustering.
- **Access**: Available at [TCGA Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

### 2. **GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)**

- **Description**: GEO contains transcriptomics and multi-omics datasets for various organisms and conditions. It supports the clustering of gene expression data.
- **Data Types**: Primarily transcriptomics, but some multi-omics datasets are included.
- **Use Case**: Best for clustering and identifying gene expression signatures.
- **Access**: Available at [GEO Data Portal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
